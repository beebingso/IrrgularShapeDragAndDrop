# 🌀 IrregularShapeDragAndDrop
> Seamless drag-and-drop with pixel-perfect snapping for irregular polygons.

## ✨ Features
- **Drag & Drop** for any path  
- **Smart Snapping** powered by Clipper.js  
- **Zero Dependencies** except vanilla JS & Clipper.js  
- **Lightweight & Fast** – under 15 kB minified  

## 🏁 Quick Start
```bash
git clone
cd IrregularShapeDragAndDrop
open index.html
```

## 🧩 How It Works
1. **Geometry** – Clipper.js handles polygon offset & intersection.  
2. **Interaction** – Native Pointer Events for smooth dragging.  
3. **Snapping** – Real-time distance calculation to nearest edge/vertex.
